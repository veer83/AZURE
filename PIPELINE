In the updated diagram:

The Azure CI/CD pipeline includes a new stage, "Unit Test Stage," after the deployment to the non-production environment.
The trigger is set to code push events specifically on the feature branch and the dev branch.
The pipeline checks out the code from either the feature branch or the dev branch.
After deploying to the non-production environment, the pipeline proceeds to the "Unit Test Stage" to run unit tests.
After the successful completion of unit tests, the pipeline proceeds to the "Merge to Master Stage."
The "Merge to Master Stage" merges the code into the master branch.
This diagram represents an updated Azure CI/CD pipeline with code checkout from either the feature branch or the dev branch, an additional unit test stage after deployment, and code merging into the master branch.
