In the updated diagram:

The Azure Pipeline consists of a CI job, "CI Job (Feature)", which is triggered by code push events to the feature branch.
After the CI job, a deployment job, "Deploy to Non-Prod Environment", is added to deploy the code to the non-production environment.
Following the deployment, a job named "Send Message to Team Channel" is included to send a message to the Team channel with the job status.
Lastly, a job titled "Merge Code to Master Branch" is added to merge the feature branch into the master branch for deployment to the production environment.
This updated diagram reflects the specific steps of the Azure CI/CD pipeline, including CI, deployment to a non-production environment, sending a message to a Team channel, and merging the code into the master branch for production deployment.
