In the diagram:

The Azure DevOps YAML Pipeline is the main component responsible for defining the pipeline stages and steps.
The BuildAndDeploy job represents the job within the pipeline that performs the build and deployment tasks.
The Checkout step checks out the source code from the repository.
The Create New Directory step uses the Azure CLI task to create a new directory in the code repository.
The Deploy Databricks Code step utilizes the Azure CLI task to execute commands for preparing and deploying the Databricks code from the feature branch.
